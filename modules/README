This directory contains perl modules used by and developed for Day Planner
(except for the externals/ dir). Day Planner will automatically detect and
make use of them. They are required for Day Planner to work properly.

Modules:
DP::iCalendar		The iCalendar format parser used by Day Planner.
DP::GeneralHelpers	The library providing useful general helper functions
			to Day Planner
DP::CoreModules	The main Day Planner functions, split into a module for
				use between versions. Nearly all non-gui code that is not
				in any of the other modules
--
