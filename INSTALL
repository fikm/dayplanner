Installation documentation for Day Planner
------------------------------------------

Index:

3	Packaging

1 - LOCAL INSTALL
-----------------
In order to install Day Planner locally, simply type make install in the
Day Planner base directory. Either as root or as the user you wish to
use Day Planner as.

2 - LOCAL FROM THE REPOSITORY
-----------------------------
This is only recommended if you are doing Day Planner development.
Run 'make pluginprep' to prepare plugin metadata files, from there on you can
use ./dayplanner and similar commands.

3 - PACKAGING
-------------
Simply make install. If prefix is set then it will detect that a distro package
is being built and won't include Date::HolidayParser, nor any other files that
distro packages don't need (or install seperately). If you still need to install
Date::HolidayParser just make DHPinstall after make install. It will also create
a .desktop file that doesn't use any absolute paths. 

You must install (or symlink) the icons in the art/ directory yourself if you want them to
be available outside of Day Planners own art/ tree or the DATADIR/pixmaps/ tree.

An example of a packaged Day Planner is in ./devel-tools/rpm/package.spec
