* LOCAL INSTALL - SINGLE USER *
You can simply run ./dayplanner from this directory (and ./tools/BuildLocale first
if you want localization).

If you want to *install* day planner run ./tools/installer/InstallLocal
This will start the day planner installer used in the day planner packages.

Building the locale files requires msgfmt from gettext installed.

* GLOBAL INSTALL - MULTI USER and PACKAGERS *
If you're a packager you may want to look at tools/rpm/* and perhaps also at
tools/CreatePackages and possibly tools/installer/MainInstallerPart

This is a bit trickier, these files should go into $PATH somewhere, such as in /usr/local/bin or
/usr/bin/ and be +x:
- dayplanner
- dayplanner-notifier
- dayplanner-daemon

These files should go into the systems standard icons directory OR either /usr/share/dayplanner/
or /usr/local/dayplanner/:
- art/dayplanner_16.png
- art/dayplanner_24.png
- art/dayplanner_48.png
- art/dayplanner_HC16.png
- art/dayplanner_HC24.png
- art/dayplanner_HC48.png
(The HC icons are high-contrast versions of the other ones)

These files should go into either /usr/share/dayplanner/ or /usr/local/dayplanner/:
- art/dayplanner-about.png

If you place the executeables in the same dir as the *png's then the png's can be anywhere
in the filesystem. A trick if day planner can't detect its images properly is to
place the executeables in the same directory as the art/ subdirectory and then
just symlink the executeables into $PATH, day planner handles $PATH fine.

Lastly, for internationalization you want to run ./tools/BuildLocale /dir.
On most systems this would be: ./tools/BuildLocale /usr/locale/
