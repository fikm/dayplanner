* LOCAL INSTALL - SINGLE USER *
Just run ./dayplanner from this directory, it isn't harder.

* GLOBAL INSTALL - MULTI USER and PACKAGERS *
This is a bit trickier, these files should go into $PATH somewhere, such as in /usr/local/bin or
/usr/bin/ and be +x:
- dayplanner
- dayplanner-notifier
- dayplanner-daemon

These files should go into the systems standard icons directory OR either /usr/share/dayplanner/
or /usr/local/dayplanner/:
- art/dayplanner_16.png
- art/dayplanner_24.png
- art/dayplanner_48.png
- art/dayplanner_HC16.png
- art/dayplanner_HC24.png
- art/dayplanner_HC48.png
(The HC icons are high-contrast versions of the other ones)

These files should go into either /usr/share/dayplanner/ or /usr/local/dayplanner/:
- art/dayplanner-about.png

If you place the executeables int he same dir as the *png's then the png's can be anywhere
in the filesystem.
