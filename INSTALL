Installation documentation for Day Planner
------------------------------------------

Index:
1	Local install
2	Packaging

1 - LOCAL INSTALL
-----------------
In order to install Day Planner locally, simply type make install in the
Day Planner base directory. Either as root or as the user you wish to
use Day Planner as.

2 - PACKAGING
-------------
Packagers can use the distinstall make target. This does the same as make install
but doesn't install the Date::HolidayParser module bundled with Day Planner
(this is expected to be provided seperately in this case, if it isn't then you
should also do make DHPinstall afterwards), fails if gettext is not available (make install doesn't)
and doesn't install the tools. The .desktop file created using this also doesn't use
any absolute paths.

You must install (or symlink) the icons in the art/ directory yourself if you want them to
be available outside of Day Planners own art/ tree.

An example of a packaged Day Planner is in ./devel-tools/rpm/package.rpm
