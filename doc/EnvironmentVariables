Day Planner-specific environment variables
$Id$
------------------------------------------

DP_DISABLE_SERVICES
			Disables the DPS if set to 1.

DP_FORCE_LEGACY_I18N
			Forces the use of the legacy Locale::gettext
			functions if set to 1.

DP_FORCE_GETTEXT_WORKAROUND
			Forces the use of a gettext workaround for
			specific versions of Gtk2. The use of this
			is usually autodetected but you can force it
			on and off by using this env var.
			Forced to on if set to 1, forced to off if
			set to anything else.

			If you're experiencing weird problems with
			accented characters, try setting this to 0
			or 1 (either might help, depending on setup
			and versions).

DP_FORCE_24H
			Forces Day Planner into 24 hour mode if
			set to 1.

DP_DISABLE_EXCEPTIONSHANDLER
			Disables the Day Planner Glib installed
			exceptions handler.

DP_HTTP_FORCEUSEOF
			Force use of a certain HTTP backend. This can be one of:
			LWP, wget, curl, lynx

			The LWP backend is recommended if available.
			If not set then it will be autodetected.

DP_NO_STRICT_PERMS
			Forces Day Planner not to enforce 0600 mode on the
			calendar file if set to 1.

DP_BYPASS_MANAGER
			Bypasses the use of DP::iCalendar::Manager if set to 1 - this can
			assist in identifying where an issue lies (in
			DP::iCalendar, the data or the Manager).
