1 - INTRODUCTION
================
This document outlines a set of tests for Day Planner.
If one of these tests does not produce the result outlined in this
document, that will in nearly all cases be considered a release
critical bug.

One thing to note is that you do not need to perform all tests to be
helpful (usually section 2, and probably 3 will be enough). Any
results are helpful.

When reporting failure/pass information for this, you need simply list
the tests, not the whole document. Like so:
2.1 - failed. Bla bla happened instead.
2.2 - pass

In addition to that you will need to provide the revision number of
the TESTCASES file you used. This one is: $Rev$

2 - MAIN GUI
============
These are tests on the main Day Planner GUI.

2.1 - First startup
-------------------
Action: Start Day Planner for the first time. In order to get a clean
	Day Planner you can run it with the -t commandline option. This
	will give you a clean instance that does not modify any data you
	already have in your normal day planner.

	If you already have run Day Planner with -t before, delete
	~/.config/dayplanner/debug beforehand.

	If you use -t, then use it on all subsequent tests aswell.
Expected result:
	The import dialog appears if a source to import from is available,
	welcoming you to Day Planner and displaying sources which you can
	import from. If you don't have a source to import from, this
	should not appear.

	After that the Day Planner window should appear and you should be
	able to close it normally.

2.2 - Second startup
--------------------
Action: Start Day Planner
Expected result: The Day Planner window appears

2.3 - Adding a simple event
---------------------------
Action: Open the «add event» window (either via the menu, or the
	toolbutton). Type some summary, select tomorrow as the date and
	add the event.
Expected result: The event appears in the list for tomorrows events,
	both in the main list and in the «upcoming events» list (the one
	in the lower right corner).

2.4 - Adding a recurring event
------------------------------
Action: Open the «add event» window (either via the menu, or the
	toolbutton). Type some summary, select tomorrow as the date.
	Expand advanced options, enable recurrance. Add one event per
	recurrance type (daily, weekly, monthly).
Expected result: The event recurs with the selected interval.

2.5 - Adding a birthday
-----------------------
Action: Open the «add event» window (either via the menu, or the
	toolbutton). Select «Birthday». Type some name,
	select 06.04.1988 as the date.
Expected result: On 06.04.1988 it says "NAME was born" and on
	06.04.2008 this year it says "NAME's birthday (20 years old)".
	The event is not displayed on 06.04.1978.

2.6 - Adding a full day event
---------------------------
Action: Open the «add event» window (either via the menu, or the
	toolbutton). Select «full day event». Type some summary,
	select tomorrow as the date.
Expected result: The event appears in the list for tomorrows events,
	both in the main list and in the «upcoming events» list (the one
	in the lower right corner). The event is displayed without any
	time.

3 - ICALENDAR
=============
These are tests on iCalendar importing and exporting.
