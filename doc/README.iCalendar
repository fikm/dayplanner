Day Planner defines birthdays with additional settings. It is fully
compatible with iCalendar and has a iCalendar-standard SUMMARY tag
containing the name of the person and a localized birthday string.
But in addition to that it includes additional options in order to
support dynamic re-localization of strings. It sets:

X-DP-BIRTHDAY:TRUE
X-DP-BIRTHDAYNAME:[NAME]

X-DP-BIRTHDAYNAME is set to the name of the person whose birthday it is,
and quoted according to iCalendar quoting standards.
