TODO list for the interface of Day Planner (particulary for GNOME HIG conformance):

01:01:51 <      uws> Zero_Dogg: Don't use borders around groups of options in dialogs
01:02:05 <      uws> adjust the dialog spacing as specified in the HIG (12px and such)
01:02:17 <      uws> Zero_Dogg: strftime() provides localized month names
01:02:36 <      uws> Zero_Dogg: All localized data stuff is available through strftime basically
01:03:03 <      uws> Zero_Dogg: The add dialog allows empty event titles
01:03:15 <      uws> there's incorrect spacing around the toolbar
01:03:27 <      uws> the columns are not sortable on click
01:03:33 <      uws> the about box crashes the app
01:03:41 <      uws> there's no window icon
- Get a statusbar where the saving progressbar will be ?
