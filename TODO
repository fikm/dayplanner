Day Planner TODO list, in no particular order.

- Move GUI add/edit events to OO-code
- Add a GUI for calendar subscriptions
- Use Conduit for synchronization of Calendars (except when using
	DPServices). Offer:
	- Sync with online server
		- Just add minor things to the current Synchronization
			interface
	- Sync with device
		- Calendar -> Synchronize with device ?
- Support for viewing read-only calendars
- Add a prompt when started with a iCalendar file on the commandline
	that asks if you want to view it (ro-mode) or import it.
- Add support for choosing how long an event lasts
- Visual indicators that an event has details
- A better way than having to use "edit" to view details (Gtk2::Expander
  in the list?)
