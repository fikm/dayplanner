* Version 0.1
- Tooltips
- Have a third party look over all strings (in the pot-file) and try to
	simplify those too technical
- Look over TODOs and FIXMEs from the code

* Version 0.2
- Add doubleclick support for the eventlist
- Add a week overview
- Add support for am/pm
	- This will be "emulated" in the sense that the internal clock and
	data format will still use 24H time, but an internal function will translate
	it from 24H to AM/PM before displaying it to the user. Should not
	require too much extra work. Perhaps the use of AM/PM can be detected
	using strftime?
