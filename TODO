- Create a feature to choose *how* long a event lasts
	- Rewrite the entry box as something else
- Create the dayplanner-daemon
	- A notification daemon with its own small datafile that contains the events
	  of the last 4-5 days
	- Pop up a notification dialog if DISPLAY is set or run system("wall ...");
	  or, if even that isn't possible then just print it to STDOUT and print a
	  error to STDERR.
	- *IF* dayplanner is running AND it isn't possible to notify NOR wall, then
	  have some way to notify dayplanner and make it pop up a dialog
	- Dayplanner starts it if it isn't running when starting UNLESS
	  a configuration setting is set. This setting should be either not displayed
	  or hidden away in some advanced configuration dialog
- Add a lockfile (IMPORTANT)
- Add doubleclick support for the eventlist
- Add default button in dialogs
- Add support for three different types of events:
	- events.dpd (normal day-to-day events)
	- birthdays.dpd (Birthdays)
	- special.dpd (Support for: repeat every ... days, ... months, and also support for
			repeat until ...)
	The most important to get implemented is birthdays
