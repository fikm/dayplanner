* Version 0.1
- Create the dayplanner-daemon
	- A notification daemon with its own small datafile that contains the events
	  of the last 4-5 days
	- Pop up a notification dialog if DISPLAY is set or run system("wall ...");
	  or, if even that isn't possible then just print it to STDOUT and print a
	  error to STDERR.
	- *IF* dayplanner is running AND it isn't possible to notify NOR wall, then
	  have some way to notify dayplanner and make it pop up a dialog
	- Find a nontechnical name for it for the few places the user will need
	  to know about it
	- Lock connections in the daemon, max one at any time, which in practice means
	only one dayplanner running at any one time (to avoid data loss)
- Add default button in dialogs
- Add support for birthdays.dpd
- Have a third party look over all strings (in the pot-file) and try to
	simplify those too technical
- Rewrite the time box as something else
- Look over TODOs and FIXMEs from the code

* Version 0.2
- Add right click on events
- Add doubleclick support for the eventlist
- Create a feature to choose *how* long a event lasts
- Have a third party look over all strings (in the pot-file) and try to

* Version 0.3

- Add special.dpd (Support for: repeat every ... days, ... months, and also support for
			repeat until ...)
- Have a third party look over all strings (in the pot-file) and try to
	simplify those too technical
