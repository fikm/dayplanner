- Create the dayplanner-daemon
	- A notification daemon with its own small datafile that contains the events
	of the last 4-5 days
- Add doubleclick support for the eventlist
- Add support for three different types of events:
	- events.dpd (normal day-to-day events)
	- birthdays.dpd (Birthdays)
	- special.dpd (Support for: repeat every ... days, ... months, and also support for
			repeat until ...)
	The most important to get implemented is birthdays
