This readme file is about the CreatePackages script included in
Day Planner.

The script is used to build the source tarball, the Mandriva Linux RPMs
and the self-contained installer package. So by default you will need to
have makeself installed, rpm installed and tar+bzip2 installed.

By simply running it the script will build the source tarball,
the Mandriva Linux RPMs and the self-contained installer of your current
checked out svn tree of Day Planner and save them to ./packages/

If you're not on a Mandriva Linux-based GNU/Linux distribution
(or perhaps not on a GNU/Linux distribution at all) you may want to
skip building the RPM. You can force the CreatePackages script to
skip building the RPMs by exporting the environment variable
DP_NORPM=1 before running the script. When building an RPM you can
also force CreatePackages to save the build log by exporting the
environment variable DP_SAVERPMLOG=1 before running the script.

If you for some reason don't want to build the makeself
self-contained installer package either you can export the
environment variable DP_NOINSTALLER=1 before running the script.

The combination of DP_NORPM=1 and DP_NOINSTALLER=1 will make
CreatePackages only create the source tarball (so it will always
require tar, bzip2).

You can also set the env var DP_SANITYONLY to 1 in order
to make CreatePackages exit after the sanity check.
