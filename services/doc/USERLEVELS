Userlevel:      Explanation:
0               Expired, no access at all
1               Expired, read-only access
2               Active, rw access
3               Active, rw access
4               Active, rw access and ADMIN command access

Level 1 is provided to allow a "grace period" between an active level
(2 and 3) and the expired level (0). This can be used for paying services
where you reduce access to 1 for a preiod when the account expires
and isn't renewed. Just allow userlevel 1 or so for a few weeks.
